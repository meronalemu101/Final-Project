# Final-Project BY: Meron Alemu

# This code uses the PsychoPy library to display the images of the three cups in a window. It loads the images of the cups, shuffles them, and then displays them one by one in the window for .5 seconds. After each image is displayed, the user is asked to enter a cup letter. If the user's guess is correct within 5 tries, the game ends and the user wins. Otherwise, the user loses.
